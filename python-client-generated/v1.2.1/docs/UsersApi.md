# tmi_client.UsersApi

All URIs are relative to *https://api.tmi.dev*

Method | HTTP request | Description
------------- | ------------- | -------------
[**delete_user_account**](UsersApi.md#delete_user_account) | **DELETE** /me | Delete authenticated user account and all data
[**logout_current_user**](UsersApi.md#logout_current_user) | **POST** /me/logout | Logout current user
[**transfer_current_user_ownership**](UsersApi.md#transfer_current_user_ownership) | **POST** /me/transfer | Transfer ownership of all owned resources


# **delete_user_account**
> DeletionChallenge delete_user_account(challenge=challenge)

Delete authenticated user account and all data

Two-step deletion process:
1. First call (no challenge parameter) - Returns challenge string
2. Second call (with challenge parameter) - Confirms deletion

Ownership behavior:
- Shared threat models: Transfers ownership to another owner from authorization list
- Unshared threat models: Deletes completely along with all child resources

### Example

* Bearer (JWT) Authentication (bearerAuth):

```python
import tmi_client
from tmi_client.models.deletion_challenge import DeletionChallenge
from tmi_client.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint

# Defining the host is optional and defaults to https://api.tmi.dev
# See configuration.py for a list of all supported configuration parameters.
configuration = tmi_client.Configuration(
    host = "https://api.tmi.dev"
)

# The client must configure the authentication and authorization parameters
# in accordance with the API server security policy.
# Examples for each auth method are provided below, use the example that
# satisfies your auth use case.

# Configure Bearer authorization (JWT): bearerAuth
configuration = tmi_client.Configuration(
    access_token = os.environ["BEARER_TOKEN"]
)

# Enter a context with an instance of the API client
with tmi_client.ApiClient(configuration) as api_client:
    # Create an instance of the API class
    api_instance = tmi_client.UsersApi(api_client)
    challenge = 'challenge_example' # str | Challenge string from first request (step 2 only). Must match exactly. (optional)

    try:
        # Delete authenticated user account and all data
        api_response = api_instance.delete_user_account(challenge=challenge)
        print("The response of UsersApi->delete_user_account:\n")
        pprint(api_response)
    except Exception as e:
        print("Exception when calling UsersApi->delete_user_account: %s\n" % e)
```

# **logout_current_user**
> logout_current_user()

Logout current user

Revokes the authenticated user's current JWT token. This is a convenience endpoint that automatically revokes the token used to authenticate the request, without requiring the token to be passed in the request body. The token is immediately added to the blacklist and cannot be used for further requests.

### Example

* Bearer (JWT) Authentication (bearerAuth):

```python
import tmi_client
from tmi_client.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint

# Defining the host is optional and defaults to https://api.tmi.dev
# See configuration.py for a list of all supported configuration parameters.
configuration = tmi_client.Configuration(
    host = "https://api.tmi.dev"
)

# The client must configure the authentication and authorization parameters
# in accordance with the API server security policy.
# Examples for each auth method are provided below, use the example that
# satisfies your auth use case.

# Configure Bearer authorization (JWT): bearerAuth
configuration = tmi_client.Configuration(
    access_token = os.environ["BEARER_TOKEN"]
)

# Enter a context with an instance of the API client
with tmi_client.ApiClient(configuration) as api_client:
    # Create an instance of the API class
    api_instance = tmi_client.UsersApi(api_client)

    try:
        # Logout current user
        api_instance.logout_current_user()
    except Exception as e:
        print("Exception when calling UsersApi->logout_current_user: %s\n" % e)
```
